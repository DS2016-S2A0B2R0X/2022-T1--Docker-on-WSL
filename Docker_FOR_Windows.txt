Here are a few helpful Docker commands to know:

List the commands available in the Docker CLI by entering: docker
List information for a specific command with: docker <COMMAND> --help
List the docker images on your machine (which is just the hello-world image at this point), with: docker image ls --all
List the containers on your machine, with: docker container ls --all or docker ps -a (without the -a show all flag, only running containers will be displayed)
List system-wide information regarding the Docker installation, including statistics and resources (CPU & memory) available to you in the WSL 2 context, with: docker info
